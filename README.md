# resource-management-in-cloud-computing-based-on-predictive-resource-scaling

Cloud computing is being widely utilized as an effective and extensive technology in largescale computing systems and services. In recent years, significant research has been conducted in the field of resource management techniques, focusing on optimal allocation of cloud resources among multiple users.
Efficient resource management in cloud computing is a vital issue because allocating resources beyond the actual need increases costs for both cloud providers and customers, while allocating
insufficient resources may lead to delays or SLA violations. Given the complexity and continuous changes in this industry, determining resource capacity and utilization efficiency to meet computational needs has become one of the main challenges. Therefore, resource management is a fundamental and critical aspect of cloud computing that greatly impacts the performance and efficiency of cloud systems and services.
The primary objectives of resource management in this domain include increasing resource efficiency and utilization, reducing costs, improving performance, and optimizing energy management. Given these challenges, data analysis and machine learning methods can serve as effective tools for predicting and optimizing the utilization of cloud resources.

In this project, we aim to investigate and compare some statistical methods and machine learning algorithms to identify the most optimal approaches among them that improve the performance and
efficiency of resource management in cloud computing.
